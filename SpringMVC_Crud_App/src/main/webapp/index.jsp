			records of the employees of Government of Odisha; through HRMS, an
			employee may apply for leave, loan, or send their reports, requests
			or grievances. They can receive the sanction or reply online from
			their office. HRMS software automatically prepares all accounts and
			registers of an employee, like Service Book, Leave Account, Loan
			Account, Salary Account, Incumbency Chart etc., retrieving relevant

			Service Book of each employee is the most complete repository of such
			transactions. Hence, service data of each employee from the service
			book is the backbone of HRMS database.<br>
