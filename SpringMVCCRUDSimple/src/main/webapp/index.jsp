			society under the General Administration Department, Government of
			Odisha. HRMS is a database â€“ and - application software to carry
			out personnel transaction of government employees online through
			Internet. This aims to be the primary vehicle of transactions of
			government employees. HRMS is the repository of all the service
			records of the employees of Government of Odisha; through HRMS, an
			employee may apply for leave, loan, or send their reports, requests
			or grievances. They can receive the sanction or reply online from
			their office. HRMS software automatically prepares all accounts and
			registers of an employee, like Service Book, Leave Account, Loan
			Account, Salary Account, Incumbency Chart etc., retrieving relevant
			data from transactions. It also helps the super annuating employees to
			prepare their pension papers on the click of buttons and help
			authorities to process pension papers easily and quickly. Past
			transactions are captured as legacy data and incorporated into the
			database, and subsequent transactions are recorded in real time. The
			Service Book of each employee is the most complete repository of such
			transactions. Hence, service data of each employee from the service
			book is the backbone of HRMS database.<br>
